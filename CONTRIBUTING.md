# Contributing to HexDetector

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HexDetector! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HexDetector.git
   cd HexDetector
   ```
   
   Or clone the original repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hexnin3x/HexDetector.git
   cd HexDetector
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .  # Install in development mode
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Run Tests

Before submitting, run the test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_data.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### 4. Commit Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: descriptive message about what you changed"
```

Good commit message examples:
- `Add support for PCAP file format`
- `Fix memory leak in data preprocessing`
- `Update XGBoost hyperparameters for better accuracy`
- `Improve documentation for feature extraction`

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear description of changes
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Test results

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

Follow PEP 8:
```python
# Good
def process_network_traffic(data, threshold=0.5):
    """
    Process network traffic data and detect anomalies.
    
    Parameters:
    data (DataFrame): Network traffic data
    threshold (float): Detection threshold
    
    Returns:
    DataFrame: Processed data with anomaly flags
    """
    processed_data = clean_data(data)
    return detect_anomalies(processed_data, threshold)

# Bad
def processNetworkTraffic(d, t=0.5):
    pd = clean_data(d)
    return detect_anomalies(pd, t)
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use Google-style or NumPy-style docstrings
- Include type hints when possible
- Update README.md for new features

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

```python
def test_data_loader_handles_empty_file():
    """Test that DataLoader gracefully handles empty CSV files"""
    loader = DataLoader()
    result = loader.load_data('empty_file.csv')
    assert result is None or result.empty
```
